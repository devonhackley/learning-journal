# LJ Code 201 - Day 10

So here we are, end of week two. It has been a long week and I'm glad that it is coming to an end. I feel like I've come so far in such a long time. I keep thinking, that before this I had no clue how to build a website, and I feel now I at least know a little something. Not much has changed since last journal entry, still hanging in there. I definitely thought that the coding demo yesterday was extremely helpful and was a nice guide for this current project.
