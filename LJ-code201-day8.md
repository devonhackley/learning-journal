# LJ Code 201 - Day 8

So we are almost done with week 2. Crazy. I definitely feel a bit better than I did the last time I had a journal entry. I think I was so worked up about missing class on monday and just trying too hard to compare my progress with others that I lost track of what matters. It was nice to have that one-on-one yesterday, to really gain so clarity and too overall just exhale. This is a lot of work, and we are learning a lot of stuff, but the end goal is still the same, and I think I just need to keep that in focus. In terms of the material, I feel a lot better about working with javascript to build a website. I'm starting to see how things are connected. I still don't know how I feel about pair programming though. The situation I was in, was kind of weird. But after discussing it, I found that its best to get my partners up to speed to not only benefit them, but myself as well, by solidifying the knowledge that I have (that's if I'm telling them the right thing haha). I wish we had a couple more weeks left, but I am excited to tackle next week and project week!
