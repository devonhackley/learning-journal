# LJ Code 201 - Day 5

Week 1 done! Wow I know it's just the first week but I'm really proud of myself and my classmates for completing the first week. I learned so much about online repositories and how to work with them, and designing webpages with using html/css. With each day I think I am feeling a little more confident. I'm really excited for the 2nd week and the weeks to come.

I thought group work was pretty interesting, I've never worked in that kind of dynamic before. I felt that as in a navigator role I was able to really talk out how I wanted to solve the problem, instead of just aimlessly typing away at first. I'm not sure if I like the driver role as much. It was hard not to also direct the way we were going with it. I definitely want to try this a lot more, maybe even with more people on my team.
