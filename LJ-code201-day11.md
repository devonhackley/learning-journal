# LJ Code 201 - Day 11

So this is the start of the third week. In just a short two weeks we will be done with this course.
Overall, I feel pretty good, not yet solid, but still pretty good on the material. This week assignment is a little interesting, in that we actually use a lot of what we learned last week with constructors and event listeners. I have a start to it, but I definitely will need help on it today. I haven't really thought about a project idea, so I will keep that in mind as well. Here's to hoping for a good end to this course!
